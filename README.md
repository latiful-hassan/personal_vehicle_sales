# personal_vehicle_sales_viz
Cleaned raw-data on personal vehicle sales and created vizzes:
  - data was cleaned by removing rows that would be considered data in Tableau as well as removing duplicates
  - data was further cleaned by using Tableau's 'Data Interpreter' and removed unnecessary columns
  - a bar chart was created showing the sum of the vehicles sold by year and region
  - a polygon map was created showing the sum of vehicles sold
